# Vision

We aim to create an NFT project that **connects quality projects and their holders on Solana** by featuring them in our collection. **Solana NFT investors from all communities** will join in our group and show-off their NFTs. This will make our connections in the Solana NFT community very diverse with the **highest succes for a high-quality alpha group**. Our modern (and magical) looking unique rooms are made for showcasing your NFTs, but don't fall asleep because that's not all! Our **staking mechanism** to earn $LUXR is **unique**. You'll have to **strategically choose your NFT(s) to optimize your earnings** (read further).

In addition, we envision a quality DAO pursuing WL spots from ambitious projects with experience alpha hunters. We'll setup a **valuable LuxuryBank** with our DAO community, which will **receive a part of royalties**. The **DAO will play a crucial role**, as they will be able to vote on a council, on the NFTs and items being raffled/auctioned, on the theme of our second 3D collection (we're thinking PFP-like in a hyped theme) and on the additional utilities of $LUXR. \
\
Long-term, if funds from mint + royalties allow us we want to implement **customization of the rooms**, which means holders will be able to **switch the furniture**! In addition, we want to create a **3D PFP collection** with a theme that was co-decided by our DAO. We will hire **strong marketing** agents to create a hype around this project. **Room holders will receive WL priority + discount and receive direct royalties reward from this hyped collection!**
