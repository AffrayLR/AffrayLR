### About the project

**What's unique?** \
Our art is not another PFP collection that weâ€™ve seen before. Also, within the Real Estate NFT community our **quality of art is innovative and fresh**. We offer a **unique staking mechanism** stimulating people to **strategically choose their NFTs to optimize passive income.**

Our collection of 3333 Luxury Rooms features quality NFT projects and bluechip holders. Stake to earn $LUXR and upgrade your room to feature YOUR NFTs. Roadmap includes a LuxuryDAO, LuxuryBank, in-real-life items & NFT raffles and auctions in $LUXR for unlisted holders. Our DAO will be crucial as they'll be co-deciding on $LUXR utilities, raffled NFTs and items, future of the project and theme of 3D PFP collection. Join the LuxuryVerse in your Web3 personal space with like-minded investors.
