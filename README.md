Our collection of 3333 Luxury Rooms features quality NFT projects and bluechip holders connecting the Solana NFT space. Stake to earn $LUXR and upgrade your room to feature YOUR NFTs. Our Roadmap includes rarity-based staking where both high and low rarity have unique importances, implementing the ability to customize your room and change furniture.
